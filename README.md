# Rainbow Shenanigans

A client-side [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) mod that makes a couple color-related changes:
- Sorts colored blocks and items (like wool and dyes) by color.
- Makes jeb_ sheep cycle through colors in a more rainbowy fashion.
- Changes the colors of the vanilla "Colormatic" splash.

The color order for each of these can be changed individually in the config screen (accessible through [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu)). Note that some settings use [dye colors](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Dye#Color_values) (replace spaces with underscores) while others use [formatting code names](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes#Color_codes).

Requires [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) version 4.9 or later.
