# Rainbow Shenanigans

A client-side [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) mod that makes a couple color-related changes:
- Sorts colored blocks and items (like wool and dyes) by color
- Makes jeb_ sheep cycle through colors in a more rainbowy fashion
- Changes the colors of the vanilla "Colormatic" splash

Requires [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) version 4.9 or later.
